# Metro Network Analysis: Delhi

Analyzing the metro network in a city like Delhi helps improve urban transportation infrastructure, leading to better city planning and enhanced commuter experiences.

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the metro network in Delhi to gain insights into its operational efficiency, passenger flow, and spatial distribution. By examining various aspects such as station layouts, temporal development, and geographical distribution, we can better understand the dynamics of the Delhi Metro system.

## Process for Metro Network Analysis of Delhi

1. **Determine Objectives:**
   Determine what you want to achieve. It could be optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, or understanding travel patterns.

2. **Collect Data:**
   Collect data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.

4. **Visualization:**
   Create visual representations of the network, such as route maps, passenger flow charts, or heat maps of station congestion.

5. **Analysis:**
   Analyze how effectively the network handles passenger traffic and meets operational targets.

## Geographical Distribution of Delhi Metro Stations

Here is the map showing the geographical distribution of Delhi Metro stations. Each marker represents a metro station, and you can hover over or click on the markers to see the station name and the metro line it belongs to. This map provides a visual understanding of how the metro stations are spread across Delhi.

## Temporal Development of Delhi Metro

The bar chart illustrates the number of Delhi Metro stations opened each year. This visualization helps us understand the temporal development of the metro network. Some key observations include:

- Some years show a significant number of new station openings, indicating phases of rapid network expansion.
- Conversely, there are years with few or no new stations, which could be due to various factors like planning, funding, or construction challenges.

## Station Layout Analysis

Next, I’ll explore the station layouts (Elevated, Ground Level, Underground). I’ll analyze the distribution of these layouts across the network and see if there are any patterns or trends, such as certain lines favoring a particular layout.

### Observations:

- **Elevated Stations:** 
  - The majority of the stations are Elevated. It is a common design choice in urban areas to save space and reduce land acquisition issues.

- **Underground Stations:** 
  - The Underground stations are fewer compared to elevated ones. These are likely in densely populated or central areas where above-ground construction is less feasible.

- **At-Grade Stations:** 
  - There are only a few At-Grade (ground level) stations, suggesting they are less common in the network, possibly due to land and traffic considerations.
